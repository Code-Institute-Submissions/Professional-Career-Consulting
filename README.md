 ## Testing
 
 Testing was done intensively with every single line of code so I can see what changes occur and what other part of the code is it affected by it. The most difficult part was the media rule, the textarea from contact page doesn't shrinks to the same ration as the whole page. In rest all the blocks alignes so that te content is not compromised.
 
 ## Validator testing
 
  HTML - No errors found when checked with W3C Markup   
  CSS -  No errors found when checked with W3C 
  
  ## Deployment
  
  For deployment to GitHub pages the folowing steps were taken:
  In the GitHub repositories I have selected Setings tab
  From GitHub pages I've selected main Branch and from here it only took seconds until my site got published.
